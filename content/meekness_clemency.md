# Meekness and Clemency

## Quotes from Scripture

[Matthew 11:27-30](https://www.drbo.org/chapter/47011.htm): "All things have been delivered to me by My Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal Him. Come to Me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."

[Matthew 5:4](https://www.drbo.org/chapter/47005.htm): "Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land."

[Psalm 131](https://www.drbo.org/chapter/21131.htm)
O LORD, my heart is not proud,
nor haughty my eyes.
I have not gone after things too great,
nor marvels beyond me.

Truly, I have set my soul
in tranquility and silence.
As a weaned child on its mother,
as a weaned child is my soul within me.

O Israel, wait for the LORD,
both now and forever.

## Quotes from the Saints

Aquinas has an entire question in the Summa dedicated to the distinction between clemency and meekness: https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3157.htm

[St. Thomas Aquinas](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3157.htm): "Meekness, in so far as it restrains the onslaught of anger, concurs with clemency towards the same effect; yet they differ from one another, inasmuch as clemency moderates external punishment, while meekness properly mitigates the passion of anger." (Summa Theologica, Question 157, Article 1)

[St. Thomas Aquinas](https://www.newadvent.org/summa/3157.htm): "Meekness is not directly opposed to severity; for meekness is about anger. On the other hand, severity regards the external infliction of punishment, so that accordingly it would seem rather to be opposed to clemency, which also regards external punishing, as stated above (Article 1). Yet they are not really opposed to one another, since they are both according to right reason. For severity is inflexible in the infliction of punishment when right reason requires it; while clemency mitigates punishment also according to right reason, when and where this is requisite. Wherefore they are not opposed to one another as they are not about the same thing." (Summa Theologica, Question 157, Article 2, Reply to Objection 1)
From the Church Fathers:

[St. Ephrem the Syrian](https://stjohndc.org/en/orthodoxy-foundation/lessons/meekness-sign-great-strength): "He meek man, on accepting blows at himself, remains firm; during quarrels, he is calm; in subordination, he is content; he is not wounded by pride; he rejoices in abasements; he is not exalted by his merits; he is not puffed up; he lives in peace with everyone."

[St. Symeon the New Theologian](https://stjohndc.org/en/orthodoxy-foundation/lessons/meekness-sign-great-strength): "The only thing a truly meek man cannot bear is the transgression of God's commandments in any man whatsoever. But even then he weeps for them that transgress these commandments and sin, and he does so as sincerely, as if he himself had sinned."

[St. Gregory of Nyssa](https://seekingvirtueandwisdom.com/st-gregory-of-nyssa-beatitudes-blog-3-blessed-are-the-meek-and-those-who-mourn/): "There is a great tendency towards evil in nature, which is quick to turn toward the worse... the habit that gives way to these evil downward impulses only slowly and with difficulty is called meekness... Man’s character is divided into opposite impulses. Wrath is opposed to gentleness, arrogance to modesty; envy to wishing people well, and hate to a loving and peaceable disposition... Blessed are those who are not easily turned towards the passionate movements of the soul, but who are steadied by reason..."

[St John Climacus](https://www.oca.org/orthodoxy/the-orthodox-faith/spirituality/the-beatitudes/meekness): "Meekness is an unchangeable state of mind which remains the same in honor and dishonor. Meekness is the rock overlooking the sea of irritability which breaks all the waves that dash against it, remaining itself unmoved. Meekness is the buttress of patience, the mother of love and the foundation of wisdom, for it is said, “The Lord will teach the meek His way” (Ps 24.9). It prepares the forgiveness of sins; it is boldness in prayer, an abode of the Holy Spirit. “But to whom shall I look,” says the Lord, “to him who is meek and quiet and trembles at my word” (Is 66.2). In meek hearts the Lord finds rest, but a turbulent soul is the seat of the devil." (The Ladder of Divine Ascent, Step 24)
